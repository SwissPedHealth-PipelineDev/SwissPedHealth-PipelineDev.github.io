<!-- ## Welcome -->

<!-- This is the documentation index for SwissPedHealth bioinformatic pipeline development. -->
<!-- You can visit the project home page at -->
<!-- <https://swisspedhealth.ch>. -->

<!-- ## About -->

<!-- ### General -->

<!-- Please contact us if you find any documentation that requires updates. --> 
<!-- We aim to include information about tools, reference datasets, databases, and any other component used in our pipelines besides sensitive and protected personal information. --> 
<!-- We will not include README information about pipeline source code here - this information should be found in the individual project repositories. -->
<!-- However, should any stable pipelines become routinely implemented, we are likely add a user guide here. --> 

<!-- ### Content -->

<!-- This documentation is made to track the public progress of SwissPedHealth pipeline development. -->
<!-- It includes information about the pipeline branches, for example DNA single variant detection, DNA CNV detection, RNA quantitative expression, etc. -->
<!-- Many features are common to different branches (e.g. reference databases, reference datasets) are therefore listed separately form branch-specific content. --> 

<!-- We rely on accurate reference data sources and therefore each component is tracked with identification information such as source location (URL, citation, etc), date, checksum, file size, contributor ID, etc. --> 
<!-- We maintain a database to ensure accurate tracking to reduce duplication or mislabelling. -->
<!-- This database is to be used for automated variable generation, reporting, and cross-project consistency. -->
<!-- We aim to maintain this database in our public git repository to promote data integrity and open science. -->

<!-- ### Data protection -->

<!-- No research data or personal information will be included in public documentation. -->
<!-- Sensitive variables will only be stored within private offline project repositories. -->
<!-- We use a public development repository to ensure a clear separation of infrastructure development and private patient data. -->

<!-- ## Documentation style -->

<!-- This site is built using the *bare-minimum* template from the --> 
<!-- "Just the Docs" theme. --> 
<!-- It uses Jekyll to build the static site which is then hosted on GitHub pages (or hosted from any other server). -->

<!-- If Jekyll is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages. -->

<!-- We currently allow GitHub pages to rebuild the site using Jekyll. -->
<!-- We have also tested the method to push the pre-built `_site`, should additional custom plugins be required. However, we aim to rely on minimum complexity. --> 

<!-- More specifically, the created site: -->

<!-- - uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem -->
<!-- - uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages -->

<!-- [Browse the theme documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme. -->

<!-- You can read about how to maintain docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo) in the template README. -->
<!-- However, this `docs` repo is a standalone repository within the SwissPedHealth-PipelineDev github orgnaisation. -->
